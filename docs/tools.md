# Tool, Resource, and Prompt Reference

Complete inventory of everything the Intervals.icu MCP server exposes: up to 65 `icu_*` tools across 12 categories, plus 4 read-only direct Strava tools, 4 MCP Resources, and 7 MCP Prompts.

## Delete Safety Mode

Destructive tools are gated by the optional `INTERVALS_ICU_DELETE_MODE` env var. The gate sits **outside the model's reach** — tools that aren't registered cannot be invoked by any prompt or parameter.

| Mode | Registered `icu_*` tools | Total incl. 4 Strava | Events | Activities | Gear | Sport settings | Custom items |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| `safe` (default) | 62 | 66 | tomorrow or later | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| `full` | 65 | 69 | any date | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `none` | 59 | 63 | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |

In `safe` mode, `icu_delete_event` and `icu_bulk_delete_events` return a uniform envelope showing what was deleted and what was skipped:

```json
{
  "deleted": [124],
  "deleted_count": 1,
  "skipped": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "reason": "past_event",
      "start_date_local": "2026-04-15",
      "hint": "Past events (today and earlier) require INTERVALS_ICU_DELETE_MODE=full."
    }
  ],
  "skipped_count": 1
}
```

Set the mode in your client config alongside the credentials:

```json
"env": {
  "INTERVALS_ICU_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
  "INTERVALS_ICU_ATHLETE_ID": "i123456",
  "INTERVALS_ICU_DELETE_MODE": "safe"
}
```

**Events vs. activities — two separate records:** An event is a calendar entry (planned workout, race, note). An activity is a recorded workout synced from a device or uploaded manually. Completing a workout links the activity to the event, but both records remain independent — deleting one leaves the other intact. Deleting an event removes the plan from your calendar; the recorded data survives. Deleting an activity permanently removes the training data; the event remains on the calendar (reverting to an unexecuted plan). This is why `icu_delete_activity` is `full`-only: it destroys recorded training data with no recovery path. Event deletion is available in `safe` mode (future events only) because removing an unexecuted plan is low-stakes.

**Why today is treated as past:** Safe mode only deletes events dated *strictly after today* in the server's local timezone. The one-day buffer absorbs server-vs-athlete TZ skew. If you run the server in Docker (defaults to UTC) and live in a different timezone, set the container's `TZ` env var to match your athlete profile (e.g., `TZ=Europe/Berlin`) so "today" lines up.

**Why sport settings and custom items are full-only:** Sport-settings deletion shifts retroactive chart math (current FTP/zones drive past activity calculations on Intervals.icu, so deleting them re-renders historical training load). Custom items can be data-bearing fields whose values are stored across activities. Neither is recoverable by re-creating the deleted record.

## Tools

### Coaching and following other athletes

Athlete-scoped tools take an optional `athlete_id`. Omit it and the tool operates on
`INTERVALS_ICU_ATHLETE_ID` from your config; pass it to target another athlete your
account can reach (e.g. `athlete_id: "i999888"`). You use **your own** API key — never
theirs. The API rejects IDs you can't access with HTTP 403.

Use **`icu_list_athletes`** to discover valid ids. It returns everyone this account can
reach, each with an `access` level (`self`, `coach`, `follower`, `none`) and a
`can_write` flag, so you can tell up front whether a write will be permitted.

Access comes from a relationship, not an account type — any Intervals.icu account can
coach. The two relationships differ:

| Relationship | Access |
| --- | --- |
| **Following** | read only |
| **Coaching** | read + write (activities, calendar, FTP and training settings) |

Both are established by request and acceptance, so an athlete must accept your coaching
request before writes succeed. Whether coaches can write *every* athlete-scoped resource
(gear and wellness in particular) is not documented upstream — those tools accept
`athlete_id` and forward it, and the API is the authority on whether the write is allowed.

Tools scoped by `activity_id` (activity details, streams, intervals, histograms,
messages) take no `athlete_id` — an activity ID is globally unique and already
identifies its owner.

Note that `athlete_id` applies to the tools only. The `intervals-icu://athlete/profile`
resource takes no arguments and always reflects the configured default athlete.

### Cycling Routing (2 tools)

Requires `OPENROUTESERVICE_API_KEY`. `OPENROUTESERVICE_BASE_URL` is optional
and defaults to `https://api.openrouteservice.org`.

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `icu_find_best_cycling_training_window` | Build a road-cycling route through ordered place names or coordinates and select the best continuous climbing-oriented training window |
| `icu_find_cycling_training_route` | Generate deterministic circular road-cycling candidates from one origin, evaluate their best training windows, discard infeasible routes, and return the best route plus eligible alternatives |

The predefined-route tool compares multiple candidate durations (20/30/40 minutes by default)
within a configurable start-time range. It returns a compact route summary,
the best window for each eligible duration, and the best overall window using
duration-normalized climbing metrics.

Optional hard eligibility requirements can reject unsuitable windows before
ranking:

- minimum asphalt percentage
- minimum road/cycleway percentage
- minimum ORS cycling suitability >= 7 percentage
- maximum footway percentage
- maximum elevation-loss rate per hour
- maximum maneuver rate per hour

All training-window eligibility thresholds are disabled by default.

`icu_find_cycling_training_route` accepts a target distance, generates 2–10
round-trip candidates with deterministic ORS seeds, and analyzes the complete
session. Each candidate includes the best training window, warmup (departure to
window start), cooldown (window end to arrival), and route-level quality. Segment
responses include duration, distance, elevation, normalized climbing and maneuver
rates, surface/suitability percentages, and interruption counts. Route-level
quality also includes surface, way type, steepness, maneuver rate, roundabouts,
and sharp turns.

Ranking is deterministic and lexicographic: training-window quality remains the
primary criterion, followed by warmup cleanliness, cooldown ease, overall route
quality, target-distance fit, and seed. There is no weighted aggregate score.

Optional hard requirements can constrain warmup and cooldown independently:

- maximum elevation-gain rate per hour
- maximum net gradient
- maximum maneuver rate per hour
- minimum asphalt percentage
- maximum footway percentage

All session requirements default to `null`. They filter candidates and remain
separate from ranking. Enabling a requirement for a missing segment makes that
candidate ineligible. Applied requirements are echoed in
`metadata.session_eligibility_requirements`.

For example, a client can request a 30 km route with a 20-minute block starting
10–15 minutes after departure, at most 8 warmup maneuvers per hour, and no more
than 300 m/h of climbing during cooldown:

```json
{
  "start_location": "39.589985,2.630108",
  "target_distance_km": 30,
  "training_durations_minutes": [20],
  "training_start_time_min_minutes": 10,
  "training_start_time_max_minutes": 15,
  "max_warmup_maneuvers_per_hour": 8,
  "max_cooldown_elevation_gain_rate_m_per_hour": 300
}
```

ORS treats round-trip length as a preferred value rather than a guarantee.
The default uses two shaping points, verified to be more stable than larger values,
and rejects routes whose absolute distance deviation exceeds 50%. Set
`max_distance_deviation_percentage=null` to disable that route-level guard.

After the distance filter and before training analysis, generated candidates are
deduplicated geometrically. The default samples each route every 100 m, considers
sampled points within 50 m to match, and removes a later candidate when the
smaller of the two directional overlap percentages is at least 90%. This symmetric
definition prevents a short route contained in only part of a longer route from
being treated as a full duplicate. Candidate order and deterministic ORS seeds
decide which geometry is retained.

The three parameters are configurable with
`deduplication_resample_spacing_m`, `deduplication_proximity_m`, and
`deduplication_overlap_threshold_percentage`. Set the threshold to `null` to
disable deduplication. Response metadata reports `candidates_generated`,
`candidates_after_distance_filter`, and `candidates_after_deduplication`, along
with the applied settings.

The generated geometry and route-quality metrics are planning aids. They do not
include real-time traffic, closures, weather, daylight, or a safety guarantee.
